MONDO:0022349	congenital absence of septum pellucidum	Disease	MONDO	The absence of the septum pellucidum is a rare condition that affects the structure of the brain. Specifically, a thin membrane called the septum pellucidum is missing from its normal position in the middle of the brain. When it is missing, symptoms may include learning difficulties, behavioral changes, seizures, and changes in vision. Absence of the septum pellucidum is not typically seen as an isolated finding. Instead, absence of the septum pellucidum is associated with other conditions such as septo-optic dysplasia. Treatment options for the condition vary depending on the underlying disorder. Diagnosis of absence of the septum pellucidum can be made through imaging such as an MRI. Symptoms of absence of the septum pellucidum typically present during childhood, but a diagnosis can also be made before an individual is born (prenatally). If an individual is found to be missing the septum pellucidum, a search for an underlying disorder should be made.

MONDO:0000004	Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome	Disease	MONDO	Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a brain disorder, due to thiamine deficiency that has been associated with both Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome. The term refers to two different syndromes, each representing a different stage of the disease. Wernicke's encephalopathy represents the 'acute' phase and Korsakoff's syndrome represents the 'chronic' phase. However, they are used interchangeable in many sites. Wernicke's encephalopathy is characterized by confusion, abnormal stance and gait (ataxia), and abnormal eye movements (nystagmus). Korsakoff's syndrome is observed in a small number of patients. It is a type of dementia, characterized by memory loss and confabulation (filling in of memory gaps with data the patient can readily recall) and involvement of the heart, vascular, and nervous system. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome mainly results from chronic alcohol use, but also from dietary deficiencies, prolonged vomiting, eating disorders, systemic diseases (cancer, AIDS, infections), bariatric surgery, transplants, or the effects of chemotherapy. Studies indicate that there may be some genetic predisposition for the disease.Treatment involves supplementing the diet with thiamine. Wernicke encephalopathy is an acute syndrome and requires emergency treatment to prevent death and neurologic complications. In cases where the diagnosis is not confirmed, patients should still be treated while additional evaluations are completed.

MONDO:0007320	chromosome 20 trisomy	Disease	MONDO	Chromosome 20 trisomy, (also called trisomy 20) is a condition in which a fetus or individual has an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 20 in some or allof of his/her cells. An extra full copy of chromosome 20 in all of a person's cells is rare, and almost all fetuses with this do not survive past the first trimester ofpregnancy. The presence of an extra copyof only part of chromosome 20 is called partial trisomy 20; and an extra copy of chromosome 20 in only some of a person's cells is called mosaic trisomy 20. Mosaic trisomy 20 is the most common type of chromosome 20 trisomy and is one of the more common chromosomal abnormalities found during prenatal diagnostic testing. Studies have shown that the child is normal in the vast majority of prenatally diagnosed individuals. However, features that have been reported include spinal abnormalities (including spinal stenosis, vertebral fusion, and kyphosis), hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), life long constipation, sloped shoulders, and significant learning disabilities despite normal intelligence. Trisomy 20 usually results from an error that occurs when an egg or sperm cell develops (before fertilization); mosaic trisomy 20 usually results from errors in cell division soon after fertilization.

MONDO:0030914	complement component 3 deficiency	Disease	MONDO	A rare genetic disorder with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. It is caused by the ineffective or decreased biosynthesis of the third complement component, C3. C3 deficiency may also be acquired acutely post-infection or chronically from co-morbid autoimmune disorders. If C3 is adequately synthesized, its rapid depletion may result in a functional deficiency. Clinical signs of the inherited deficiency present within the first decade of life and are consistent with the signs of recurrent systemic infection or immune complex disease. Deficiency of serum C3 and its major cleavage product, C3b, will decrease the effective humoral immune response to encapsulated bacteria. Deficiency of C3 also impairs clearance of circulating immune complexes and therefore predisposes to rheumatic and renal disease.

MESH:D003095	Collagen Diseases	Disease	CTD	Historically, a heterogeneous group of acute and chronic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis, etc. This classification was based on the notion that 'collagen' was equivalent to 'connective tissue', but with the present recognition of the different types of collagen and the aggregates derived from them as distinct entities, the term 'collagen diseases' now pertains exclusively to those inherited conditions in which the primary defect is at the gene level and affects collagen biosynthesis, post-translational modification, or extracellular processing directly.
